If you don't specifically need a gettext implementation, I might suggest using MessageFormat instead, as it has better support for plurals/gender and has built-in locale data.\n\n\n## Current Version\n\n`v0.5.2`\n\n## Todo\n\n* Build time generation of plural form functions\n* Web interface for building translation sets\n* Code introspection for default values\n\n## License\n\nYou may use this software under the WTFPL.\n\nYou may contribute to this software under the Dojo CLA - <http://dojofoundation.org/about/cla>\n\n\n## Author\n\n* Alex Sexton - @slexaxton - <http://alexsexton.com/>\n\n\n## Credits\n\nA good chunk of sanity checking was done against the gettext.js tests. That was written by:\n\n* Joshua I. Miller\n\nThe sprintf implementation is from:\n\n* Alexandru Marasteanu <alexaholic [at) gmail (dot] com>\n\n\n## The name\n\nThe name jed.js is an homage to Jed Schmidt (<https://github.com/jed>) the JavaScript community member who is a japanese translator by day, and a \"hobbyist\" JavaScript programmer by night. Give your kids three character names and they'll probably get software named after them too.\n",
